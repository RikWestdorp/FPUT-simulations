# Radiating Solitary Waves in an FPUT Lattice with Random Coefficients

This repository contains the code used to generate the results in the preprint:

> H.J. Hupkes, J. McGinnis, R. W. S. Westdorp, J.D. Wright, *Radiating Solitary Waves in an FPUT Lattice with Random Coefficients*.

The code simulates soliton propagation in an FPUT lattice with random heterogeneity in the linear spring force, and analyzes the resulting amplitude attenuation.
